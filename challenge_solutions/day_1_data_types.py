#there are initial data given by hackerrank
i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '

# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
#there is no need for variable declaration when writing in python so we will move to the next instruction


# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
x = int(input())
y = float(input())
z = str(input())


# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print (i + x)
# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print (d + y)
# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
print (s + z)
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
